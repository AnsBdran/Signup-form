Create and implement this UI Figma design inside the last project (the forms) as a new page:
read some articles about best practices and use them in your work
create reusable components
implement react-router in your website and have a look at (NavLink, useParams, useNavigate) in the documentation.
Create just the light theme.
Use meaningful commits.
NEVER use a functional component if it's not necessary.
Create new branches for the new work and don't remove it after merging.
Happy new year :)
